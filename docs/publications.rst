Data Management Plan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Data Management Plan (DMP) outlines how research data, including codes and models, collected, created, or generated in the eConnect project will be handled during and after the project. The DMP describes standards and methods for data storage and sharing among project collaborators, with the scientific community, the general public, and potential stakeholders. The DMP is expected to evolve with the project and its implementation is required for all partners of the eConnect project, also when data is reused after the end of the project.
